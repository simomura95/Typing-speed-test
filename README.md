# Typing speed test
GUI application to check the user's typing speed in 60 seconds, given a text randomly chosen from a selection.

When the user starts typing, the timer appears on top. When it reaches 0, the textbox is disabled and a button appears to show the results.
Clicking on it opens a messagebox that shows the number of right and wrong words typed and asks if he/she wants to try again.
If yes, the window is reset with a new text; if no, it is closed.

5 rows of text are shown on top, 15 words per each one.
After the user reaches the 4th row (which is checked by the number of words typed), the first row is deleted and the sixth one appears, simulating a scroll down.
